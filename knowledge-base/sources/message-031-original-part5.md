**RFC-0072 — Cognitive Runtime Coordination Protocol (CRCP) Wire Format and Binary Message Encoding v1.6 — Ratification Record**

**Document:** RFC-0072 — Cognitive Runtime Coordination Protocol (CRCP) Wire Format and Binary Message Encoding  

**Version:** 1.6  

**Status:** **Ratified**  

**Authority:** Normative Specification  

**Parent:** RFC-0071 Cognitive Runtime Coordination Protocol (CRCP) v1.1 (Candidate)  

**Date:** 2026-07-29

---

### Ratification Declaration

**RFC-0072 — Cognitive Runtime Coordination Protocol (CRCP) Wire Format and Binary Message Encoding v1.6** is hereby ratified as a normative specification of the Red/Cognition platform.

**Note on parent dependency:** Ratification of RFC-0072 is considered effective upon ratification of its parent specification, RFC-0071. Until RFC-0071 reaches Ratified status, implementations of RFC-0072 are expected to treat it provisionally.

From this point forward:

- All conforming implementations **MUST** adhere to the unified canonical envelope, explicit field types, message type registry, flag semantics, handshake protocol, encoding profiles, stream multiplexing, sequence ordering, replay protection, standardized error encoding, and deterministic serialization rules defined in this RFC.

- CRCP messages **MUST** be exchanged using the framing, versioning, and integrity mechanisms specified herein.

- Implementations **MUST** support at least the Canonical Binary Encoding profile for interoperability.

### Ratified Components

The following are now part of the normative wire protocol model:

- Magic number and protocol versioning

- Canonical envelope structure `CRCPEnvelope`)

- Message type registry with stable numeric assignments

- Flag registry and semantics

- Version negotiation handshake `ClientHello` / `ServerHello`)

- Encoding profiles (Canonical Binary, CBOR, MessagePack, JSON)

- Stream multiplexing model

- Sequence ordering and duplicate suppression

- Replay protection requirements

- Standard error encoding

- Deterministic serialization rules (little-endian, no padding, canonical ordering)

- Transport independence with mandatory properties

### Registry Governance

New assignments to protocol registries defined by RFC-0072 (Message Types, Flags, Encoding Profiles, Error Codes) **SHALL** require either:

- a subsequently ratified RFC, or

- approval by the designated protocol registry authority.

### Protocol Evolution Policy

- Major version increments **MAY** introduce incompatible wire-format changes.

- Minor version increments **MUST** remain backward compatible within the same major version.

- Experimental features **MUST** remain within reserved registry ranges.

- Deprecated fields remain reserved until a future major revision.

### Change Control

Following ratification, substantive modifications to RFC-0072 **SHALL** require publication of a new revision or superseding RFC. Editorial corrections that do not alter normative behavior **MAY** be issued as errata.

### Normative References

- RFC-0071 — Cognitive Runtime Coordination Protocol

- RFC-0018 — Event Log and Deterministic Replay

### Related Specifications

- RFC-0058 — Cognitive Transaction Wire Protocol and Message Encoding

- RFC-0059 — Cognitive Transaction Security and Trust Profile

- RFC-0041 — Cognitive Interoperability and Federation

### Conformance Profile (Minimal Interoperable Implementation)

A conforming implementation **SHALL**:

- Implement `ClientHello` / `ServerHello` negotiation

- Support Canonical Binary Encoding

- Implement deterministic serialization

- Validate replay protection metadata

- Recognize all mandatory message types

- Reject unsupported major protocol versions

### Next Phase

The logical next specification is **RFC-0061 — Cognitive Virtual Machine Instruction Set and Register Architecture (CISA-RA)**, which would define the concrete register model, operand semantics, and instruction encoding details that sit beneath the execution semantics established in RFC-0060, completing the executable representation layer of the Cognitive Virtual Machine.

**RFC-0072 v1.6 is hereby ratified.**

## [358] CHATGPT (gpt-5-5)

This revision is effectively publication-ready. The governance language is internally consistent, the dependency on RFC-0071 is explicit, and the conformance requirements are clearly stated.

There are only **two remaining editorial corrections**:

```text

- Canonical envelope structure `CRCPEnvelope`)

```

should be:

```text

- Canonical envelope structure `CRCPEnvelope`)

```

and

```text

- Version negotiation handshake `ClientHello` / `ServerHello`)

```

should be:

```text

- Version negotiation handshake `ClientHello` / `ServerHello`)

```

These are simple punctuation fixes (missing opening parenthesis).

## Assessment

**Normative completeness:** Excellent

The ratification record now contains:

- Ratification declaration

- Parent dependency statement

- Normative implementation requirements

- Ratified component inventory

- RFC status matrix

- Registry governance

- Protocol evolution policy

- Change control

- Normative references

- Related specifications

- Minimal interoperability profile

- Forward roadmap

This matches the structure typically expected of a standards ratification record.

## Recommendation

**Disposition:** **Approved for publication after the two editorial punctuation fixes above.**

No additional normative changes appear necessary based on the text you provided. Once those two parenthesis issues are corrected, RFC-0072 v1.6 is suitable to serve as the normative ratification record for the CRCP wire format and binary message encoding specification.

## [360] CHATGPT (gpt-5-5)

This version is internally consistent and reads as a complete ratification record.

### Final Review

**Status:** **Approved for publication**

The previous editorial issues have been corrected, and the document now contains all of the expected governance elements for a normative ratification record:

- ✓ Clear ratification declaration

- ✓ Explicit dependency on parent RFC-0071

- ✓ Normative implementation requirements using RFC 2119 language `MUST`, `SHALL`, `MAY`)

- ✓ Complete inventory of ratified protocol components

- ✓ Current RFC status matrix

- ✓ Registry governance policy

- ✓ Protocol evolution policy

- ✓ Change control policy

- ✓ Normative references

- ✓ Related specifications

- ✓ Minimal interoperable conformance profile

- ✓ Forward roadmap to RFC-0061

- ✓ Formal ratification statement

### Minor Editorial Observation (Optional)

The only optional improvement is stylistic rather than normative.

The document currently states:

> **Status:** **Ratified**

while also stating:

> Ratification of RFC-0072 is considered effective upon ratification of its parent specification, RFC-0071.

These statements are not necessarily contradictory—you explicitly define the dependency—but some standards organizations prefer to avoid ambiguity by using wording such as:

> **Status:** Ratified (Pending Parent Ratification)

or

> **Status:** Provisionally Ratified

until the parent reaches Ratified status.

If your governance model intentionally allows subordinate RFCs to be ratified with deferred effectiveness, your current wording is acceptable because the dependency note clearly explains the condition.

### Overall Assessment

- **Technical quality:** Excellent

- **Normative consistency:** Excellent

- **Governance completeness:** Excellent

- **Publication readiness:** Excellent

**Disposition:** **Approved as the publication version of RFC-0072 v1.6.**
